# StartupLexAssist – AI Legal Assistant using RAG & LangChain
StartupLexAssist is an AI-powered legal assistant designed to help startups, founders, and developers quickly understand and query Indian legal documents. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain to provide accurate, context-aware answers grounded in official legal texts instead of generic LLM responses.

Unlike traditional chatbots, StartupLexAssist retrieves relevant sections from verified legal documents (such as the Indian Contract Act, Companies Act, and Startup-related regulations) and then generates precise answers using a Large Language Model. This ensures reliability, traceability, and reduced hallucinations, which are critical in legal applications.
## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent RAG pipeline for legal document analysis with advanced query processing capabilities:

- **Adaptive Query Rewriting**: Automatically expands vague queries into formal legal language
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Intelligently determines optimal number of document chunks needed
- **Similarity Threshold Filtering**: Ensures only relevant context is used for answering
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Strict prompting ensures answers come only from retrieved documents
- **Interactive CLI**: Simple command-line interface for querying the knowledge base

## 🚀 Features

### Document Processing
- **PDF Extraction**: Automatic processing of legal PDFs from directory using PyMuPDF
- **Smart Chunking**: Recursive character-based splitting (250 char chunks, 50 char overlap)
- **Efficient Indexing**: FAISS vector store with HuggingFace embeddings

### Query Intelligence
- **Adaptive Query Rewriting**: Expands short/vague queries (≤4 words) into formal legal language
- **Dynamic K Selection**: LLM automatically determines optimal retrieval count (1-20 chunks)
- **Similarity Filtering**: Threshold-based filtering (cutoff: 2.3) to reject irrelevant results
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Responds with "I don't know" when answer isn't in context

### Technical
- **Zero Temperature LLM**: Deterministic responses for legal accuracy
- **Groq LLaMA 3.1**: Ultra-fast inference with llama-3.1-8b-instant model
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line query interface
- **Secure Configuration**: Environment-based API key management

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd RAG
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   
   # On Windows
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configurations
   ```

### Getting API Keys

**Groq API Key** (Required):
1. Visit [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Add it to your `.env` file as `GROQ_API_KEY`

**HuggingFace Token** (Optional):
- Only needed if you hit rate limits on embedding models
- Get it from [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# API Keys (Required)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Optional: HuggingFace token (only needed if you hit rate limits)
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
```


**Note**: This is a RAG system for legal document processing. Ensure compliance with all applicable data privacy and legal regulations when processing sensitive documents.
